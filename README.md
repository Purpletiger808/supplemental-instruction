# CSC1350 Supplemental Instruction
A collection of code examples produced for Supplemental Instruction for LSU's CSC1350, the introductory Java course for Computer Science majors. Every example here is covered in my sessions throughout the semester, and is free to use for educational purposes. I highly encourage downloading and running each program as well, if just to get a better understanding of the way they work and the thought processes that go into writing them.

If you have any questions, send me an email or ask during a session, I'd be happy to go over the code.
